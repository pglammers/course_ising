\section*{Preface}
These lecture notes are written progressively during the 2025 spring semester,
as the course is taught at Sorbonne university in the M2 (second-year masters) programme.
Its purpose is to give a broad introduction to the rigorous analysis of the Ising model.
The main focus is on four techniques and their applications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Peierls argument,
    \item The random-currents representation,
    \item The FKG inequality for the Ising spins,
    \item The FKG inequality for the random-cluster (FK) representation.
\end{itemize}

A basic understanding of analysis and probability theory is essential for following this course.
Experience with other models in statistical mechanics (such as the Bernoulli percolation model)
is a plus but by no means essential.

The appendices contain overviews of the main definitions, expansions, and inequalities in this text.

These notes are inspired by the lecture notes \emph{Lectures on the Ising and Potts models on the hypercubic lattice}
and the overview \emph{100 Years of the (Critical) Ising Model on the Hypercubic Lattice},
both due to Hugo Duminil-Copin.
The main text does not contain references at this stage; they will be added at a later time.
